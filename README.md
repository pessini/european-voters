This report will investigated a dataset provided by [European Social Survey](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/) (ESS) which is a biennial cross-national survey of attitudes and behaviour from European citizens. 

The study will focus on which aspects can influence for a person to vote for your country leave or remain a member of the European Union. 

After analyzing each variable individually I will build a model that after been trained can predict the probability on a person to vote for your country to Leave the European Union.

## Dataset

The topics covered by ESS are very heterogeneous and include media and social trust, politics, immigration, citizen involvement, health and care, economic, work and well-being. 

## Survey Weights

As ESS is a cross-national survey and different countries normally implement different sample designs, it is important to take weights in consideration to avoid bias the outcome.
