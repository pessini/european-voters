This report will investigated a dataset provided by [European Social Survey](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/) (ESS) which is a biennial cross-national survey of attitudes and behaviour from European citizens. 

The topics covered by ESS are very heterogeneous and include media and social trust, politics, immigration, citizen involvement, health and care, economic, work and well-being.. The analysis will focus on which aspects can influence for a person to vote for your country leave or remain a member of the European Union. 

## Dataset

The variables selected for the analysis were Country, Age, Gender, Employment status, Education and Union Membership.

## Survey Weights

As ESS is a cross-national survey and different countries normally implement different sample designs, it is important to take weights in consideration to avoid bias the outcome.
