This report will investigated a dataset provided by [European Social Survey](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/) (ESS) which is a biennial cross-national survey of attitudes and behaviour from European citizens. 

The study will focus on which aspects can influence for a person to vote for your country leave or remain a member of the European Union.
