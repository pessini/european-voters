This analysis will investigated a dataset provided by [European Social Survey](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/) (ESS) which is a cross-national survey of attitudes and behaviour from European citizens. The topics covered by ESS are very heterogeneous and include media and social trust, politics, immigration, citizen involvement, health and care, economic, work and well-being.
